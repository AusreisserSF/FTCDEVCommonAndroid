Common classes for development in Android Studio

This project is the home of the utilities that are common to all Android Studio projects.

This project builds an aar file (with a version number) that can then be loaded into any Android Studio project.
There is an analagous project for IntelliJ. The two projects both have copies of the same source code - and so must be kept in sync -
except for the subdirectories IntelliJ and Android, each of which contains platform-specific code.
